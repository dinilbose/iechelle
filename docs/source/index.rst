**iEchelle: Interactive Echelle Diagram Tool for Asteroseismology**

iEchelle is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application
designed for the interactive analysis of stellar oscillations, primarily
for asteroseismology. It allows users to load periodogram data from
FITS files, visualize and interact with echelle diagrams and
periodograms, identify and select stellar oscillation modes, manage
these selections, and compare observational data with synthetic spectra.

The tool is built using the Bokeh library for interactive plotting and UI elements.

It is licensed under the **GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 (LGPL-2.1)**.
